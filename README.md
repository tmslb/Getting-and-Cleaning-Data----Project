# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data----Project

This is the final course project for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course. As a part of this project, we were required to create an R script: run_analysis.R - which helps us in coming up with a tidy dataset that is in a consumable format or ready to use form. The steps followed for this analysis are as follows:

-Downloaded the dataset in the working directory </br>
-Loaded the activity and feature information <br />
-Loaded both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which reflect the mean or standard deviation<br />
-Loaded the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merged those columns with the dataset<br />
-Merged the two datasets<br />
-Converted the activity and subject columns into factors<br />
-Created a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.<br />
-The end result of the analysis is shown in the file ucitidy.txt.<br />
