##Code Book

This code book summarizes the resulting data fields in tidy.txt.

1. train, train_activities, train_subjects, test, test_activities, test_subjects contain the data from the downloaded files </br>
2. train data is made up of train, train_activities, train_subjects and test data is made up of test, test_activities, test_subjects </br>
3. Train and test combine to form merged data </br>
4. features_wanted uses the grep function to extract only the measurements of mean and standard deviation
5. Used descriptive activity names and labels in lines 54 and 55
4. Finally, merged_data.mean contains the relevant averages (asked in the project) which will be later stored in a .txt file. </br>
